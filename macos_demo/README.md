# objrs demo

This demo of objrs is written in 100% Rust. It uses objrs to compile to machine code that is ABI-compatible with Objective-C, allowing it to utilize native Objective-C frameworks (e.g. AppKit, Foundation, Metal, MetalKit, etc.) without any intermediary FFI bridges.

When run, the application will open a window that uses Metal to render the Rust logo. Moving your mouse across this logo will interactively distort it.

## Requirements

- A recent version of macOS (only macOS 10.14.1 has been tested).
- Nightly Rust compiler (tested on `rustc 1.32.0-nightly (5aff30734 2018-11-19)`).

## Instructions

Just `cargo run` to run the demo app. Running the latest version of the demo can be done as follows:

```sh
git clone https://gitlab.com/objrs/objrs.git
cd objrs/demo
cargo run
```

The demo is also [published on crates.io under the name `objrs_demo`](https://crates.io/crates/objrs_demo).
